            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior working on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I'm from St. Louis, Missouri. I
                came from
                two
                different universities.
                First one was the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Rolla, MO) but that university refused
                to let
                me
                take freshman CS courses, so I left.
                Next university was the University of Missouri - Saint Louis which I left because the CS program was a
                little
                too
                easy. I came here because I got a
                glowing recommendation from a friend who left MS&T. I am a guitarist and play primarily rock and jazz.

		<h2>Current</h2>
        	<p>I'm currently in my last year at college at Northwest Missouri State University. I may graduate later,
        	    because of waisted time at MS&T.
        </p>
        <h2>Future plans</h2>
        <p>I hope to do software development in the future, or possibly system administration. I used to work as IT
            staff at
            my old high school after I graduated.
